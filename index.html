       <p> This project was done in the frame of the Data Vizualisation Course (COM-480) at EPFL. </br>
       It has for purpose to show the different elements that can influence the vote of the French population through vizualisations. The time boundaries of this project are from 2002 to 2017 - this last year being the last French Presidential Election. </p> 
       <h5>"Opinion is something intermediary between knowledge and ignorance" </h5>
       <h5>- Republic, Plato</h5>
       <p>
       This quote is the basis of our work, we hope through these vizualisations to spread objective political knowledge and erase different pre-conceived pieces of information. We consider that the more people are aware of the influence of their environment on their votes, the more their votes will reflect their true values. Objective understandable political information being increasingly difficult to find (mainly because of the rise of fake news on social media), our visualizations will provide some key insights on the profile of the voters.  </br>Every data comes from a governmental source and shall not be subject to controversy or discussion. </p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">Historical Timeline</h2>
      <p>First of all, we have to dive into the French population's mindset. It seems important to focus on its environment and on the different events that occurred since 2002. A lot happened in 15 years, but we selected the main events that have the power to influence the vote of a French citizen.  Among these, we can quote the different terrorist attacks that happened in France in 2015, and which provoked fear and incomprehension, and consequently created deeply debated laws affecting minorities (face covering ban, gay marriage…). </p>

      <h2 class="mb-4">Elections Results</h2>

      <p>Have you ever wondered how the political landscape changed in France among the last years? Some of us may know the latest French  elected presidents or even the contestants of the second round. We wanted in this vizualisation to go further and explore the votes casted at the different presidential elections since 2002. </p>
      <p>The political parties and its side remain proeminent in the vote of a French citizen. Hence, we displayed the region sides (i.e which party do they mainly support) and their switch throughout the years. </p>
      <p> The France fracture between the "Left" and the "Right" has been erased by the rise of the extremes. This is now clearly visible on the vizualisation.</p> <h5>One might say "Extremes were already present in 2002!"</h5> <p>To feed the debate and nuance correctly our visualization, we showed in this vizualisation the deep erosion in the support of the elected candidate throughout the year.</p>

    <h2 class="mb-4">Voter profiles</h2>
    <p>Now that we have discovered the dynamics of the French election throughout the lens of the presidential elections, it seems important to show the profile of the voters. To do so, we chose to explore the correlation between different factors affecting the population of a department and their votes. Indeed, This visualization represents the results of statistical analysis extracting features of the departments and their support intensity to each political party/candidate. This work is based on profiles of departments established in 2016, and the votes taken into account are the ones from the 2017 Presidential election. This choice of data is justified by the cleavage and the participation of French citizens on presidential elections.</p>
    <h5>For example departments having an higher revenue will vote for the right wing (here represented by Francois Fillon).</h5>
    <p> The statistical significance of the data has for purpose to avoid generality and stereotypes, since the purpose of the project is to be as neutral and clear as possible. It seems necessary to precise that an item which is not statistically significant can not be refuted nor confirmed.
      <br>The white voters and the abstentionists profiles have also been integrated, being two majors political forces in France that kept increasing over the last few years. </p>

    <h2 class="mb-4">Votes & Salaries</h2>
    <p>As explained earlier, the vote participation remain one of the major stake of an election in France. Therefore, it seemed important to address this subject in our vizualisation and explore the percentage of voters throughout multiple French elections. The mean gross salary of the region seemed to represent a viable correlating factor with the percentage of voters.</p>
    <p class="mb-0">Filtering by regions allows to deepen the potential profile established throughout the precedent vizualisations. The data used for this visualization unfortunately stops in 2012. However, it is sufficient to develop a critical idea on the impact of the economical status on the number of voters in each major election or region.</p>

    <p>We hope you learned something through the different vizualisations we presented today. The political data can be difficult to apprehend and to display but we wanted to make this data understandable, in a more captivating way. The goal of this data story is also to tackle stereotypes and pre-conceived ideas. If you are able to think and debate about different factors which can influence your vote and your opinion on the next election...We accomplished our mission!</p>

    <p>Please consider that your vote is extremely important and represents the climax of our democracies. Cast it with precaution!</p>
